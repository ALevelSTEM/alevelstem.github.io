## Complex Numbers Basics

You are already familiar with the square root of positive numbers, e.g. $$ \sqrt{4} = 2 $$ or $$ \sqrt{9} = 3 $$.
However,  you will have likely been told that it is not possible to square root a negative number, and that as such
any quadratic function in which the discriminant $$ b^2-4ac $$ is negative will not have any roots, as this is square rooted
to find the roots of the quadratic.

However, it is possible to square root negative numbers, using a branch of mathematics known as **complex arithmetic**,
centered around what mathematicians define as the imaginary unit $$ i $$:

$$ i = \sqrt{-1} $$

Based on this, some simple inferences regarding the imaginary unit can be made:

$$ i^2 = (\sqrt{-1})^2 = -1 $$

$$ i^3 = -1 \cdot i = -i $$

$$ i^4 = -i \cdot i = 1 $$
